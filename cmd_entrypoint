CMD and ENTRYPOINT are both Dockerfile instructions that define what command should be executed when a container is started from your image. 
However, they work in slightly different ways and are used for different purposes.
CMD
Defines the default command to run when a container starts.
Can be easily overridden when starting a container with docker run.
Typically used to provide default arguments or commands for an application.
ex:
FROM ubuntu:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello from Docker!"] 

====
ENTRYPOINT
Sets the main executable for the container, making the container itself behave like that executable.
Cannot be easily overridden when starting a container (unless using the --entrypoint flag).
Typically used when you want to create a container that runs a specific application or service.
ex:
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello"]
