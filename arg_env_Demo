You should use ARG in a Dockerfile when you need to pass variables to your build process that do not need to persist in the final image. Here are some common scenarios for using ARG:

When to Use ARG
Build-time Dependencies:
If you need to install specific versions of dependencies or tools during the build process, you can use ARG to specify the version.

dockerfile
Copy code
ARG NODE_VERSION=14
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}
